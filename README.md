# Premium Portfolio

This web page was created as part of a Udemy course on [Bootstrap 4](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-beta-ultimate-projects-course/learn/v4/content). I have separated it out from the course files so I can post it online as another coding example for my portfolio.

Note that this project makes use of the [Isotope jQuery plugin](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/), and includes two photo carousels as well as some nice, subtle CSS transitions.
